# Climate-Change-Modeling

**Project Overview**

This project aims to analyze public sentiment on climate change using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging data from NASA and applying sentiment analysis tools, the project seeks to understand how people perceive and react to climate change-related topics.

**Data Sources**

NASA: The project utilizes climate-related data provided by NASA

**Technologies and Tools**

* Python: Primary programming language used for analysis.
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Employed for text processing, including tokenization, stop words removal, and other preprocessing tasks.
* Punkt: A tokenizer from NLTK used to split a text into sentences or words.
* RoBERTa: A transformer-based machine learning model used for sentiment analysis, fine-tuned for understanding climate change-related sentiments.
* VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner): A lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically tuned for social media texts, used for comparative sentiment analysis.

**Project Structure**

**Sentiment Analysis:**
* Text preprocessing using NLTK and Punkt.
* Applying RoBERTa for deep sentiment analysis.
* Cross-verifying results using VADER for a comprehensive sentiment overview.
* Modeling: Analyzing the sentiment data to model public opinion trends on climate change.
* Visualization: Graphical representation of sentiment trends over time and their correlation with climate data.

**Results**

The analysis provides insights into the publicâ€™s evolving sentiment toward climate change, correlated with real-world climate data trends. The findings can help policymakers, researchers, and activists better understand public perception and tailor communication strategies accordingly.
