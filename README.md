# Climate-Change-Modeling

**Project Overview**

This project aims to analyze public sentiment on climate change using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging data from NASA and applying sentiment analysis tools, the project seeks to understand how people perceive and react to climate change-related topics.

**Data Sources**

NASA: The project utilizes climate-related data provided by NASA

**Technologies and Tools**

* Python
* NLTK: For text preprocessing and tokenization.
* Punkt: Sentence tokenizer.
* RoBERTa: For advanced sentiment analysis.
* VADER: For rule-based sentiment analysis.
* Scikit-learn: For implementing Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifiers.
* Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

**Project Structure**

**Sentiment Analysis:**
* Text preprocessing using NLTK and Punkt.
* Applying RoBERTa for deep sentiment analysis.
* Cross-verifying results using VADER for a comprehensive sentiment overview.
* Modeling: Analyzing the sentiment data to model public opinion trends on climate change.
* Visualization: Graphical representation of sentiment trends over time and their correlation with climate data.

**Results**

The Naive Bayes Classifier achieved an accuracy of 45%.
The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 56%.
The sentiment distribution and accuracy metrics were visualized to understand the model's performance and the sentiment trends in climate change discussions.
